                <br>Java
                <br>I excel in Java programming, leveraging its robust and versatile 
                <br>features to develop scalable and high-performance applications. 
                <br>My expertise extends to Android app development, where I utilize 
                <br>Java's extensive libraries to create user-friendly and efficient 
                <br>mobile applications. Whether it's building backend systems, 
                <br>integrating APIs, or enhancing user interfaces, I have a deep 
                <br>understanding of Java's capabilities and best practices.
                <br>Python
                <br>With Python, I specialize in a broad spectrum of applications, 
                <br>including data analysis, machine learning, web development, and 
                <br>automation tasks. Python's simplicity and versatility make it an 
                <br>ideal choice for tackling complex problems. I have experience 
                <br>using libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-Learn for 
                <br>data-driven projects, Flask and Django for web development, and 
                <br>various automation tools to streamline workflows. My Python skills 
                <br>enable me to deliver insightful data analysis, build intelligent 
                <br>machine learning models, and create dynamic web applications.
                <br>HTML & CSS
                <br>I possess a strong foundation in HTML and CSS, essential for 
                <br>crafting visually appealing and responsive web interfaces. My 
                <br>skills enable me to transform design concepts into functional web 
                <br>pages that offer excellent user experiences. I am adept at using 
                <br>the latest HTML5 and CSS3 standards, ensuring compatibility 
                <br>across various browsers and devices. My attention to detail 
                <br>ensures that every web page I create is not only aesthetically 
                <br>pleasing but also highly functional and accessible.
